# Where to start?
The first step of learning everything today is simple - go to the [official website](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).

I would recommend to follow the [tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) without deploying to github first. Since apparently after this tutorial, your website is far from ready. You need to choose the right theme you want and redo the deploy again.

# Themes?
> I am a lazy person but want a beautiful blog look. So Theme is necessary for me. For hard-cored people, you can start your own theme I believe.

Astro has [a collection of themes](https://astro.build/themes/?search=&categories%5B%5D=blog&categories%5B%5D=portfolio) provided online.

Just choose the one you like, and you are right on the way to start.

Take [my theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/brutal/) as an example, follow the instructions in the github and your modification journey starts.

# How to deploy?
> Since I use Github Page, the following guide only refers to the setting up about it. Astro has one for Netlify you may want to check that out.

## Set up git repo
Once your website is ready, set up it in github following this guide [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart). Basically just change the repo name to `username.github.io`, of course the `username` is your github user name.

## Get a domain and set it up
If you want to buy a domain, personally I use [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-sg).
you need to follow this [github setting guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) to set up your domain host in the seller website, like GoDaddy in order to let github page go through.

After this step, you may have a `CNAME` file that is generated by Github, which will be used in the next step.

## Connect Astro deploy to Github Page
This is a easy part,  just follow this [Deploy your Astro Site to GitHub Pages](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/) to add a workflow.

Your `CNAME` file may be not in the right place as Astro said, you can just move it to where it belongs. I never tried another place, maybe it still works. Do let me know :)

## Check your workflow (if needed)
You may want to see whether you page is deployed, then you can go to the **Action** under Github repo and click inside of each run to see what blocks it.

After this, your website should be ready to go, like mine [here](https://kexinwei.org).
